  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>My name is Thomas and this is my blog. <br>At first, this won't seem very impressive but over time it will get alot better, I swear.
  I'm making this to capture my travels while also giving my wisdom to the world, but also a fun project to learn web based coding. Test commit.</p>
