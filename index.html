  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>My name is Thomas and this is my blog. <br>At first, this won't seem very impressive but over time it will get alot better, I swear.
  I'm making this to capture my travels while also giving my wisdom to the world, but also a fun project to learn web based coding. </p>
  
  <p> <b>May 5th, Cinco de mayo baby!</b> I had nachos today with pico de gallo. I've been working at this Ede events job for about 2 weeks. Its tough on the body but its good for hours, 43 hours followed by like 42, and next week 48. Jebacka.
  There is so many old people here in Townsville, and they keep arriving. Ante, Qubec, Matteo, Tomas, Vaclav, Montana (I think is her name). There's also some nice new english group here. Its strange but good, its alwasy gonna be hard to not compare it to the old Civic, and also view the last place with rose tinted glasses.
